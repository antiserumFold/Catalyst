# Catalyst

Catalyst is a strong UCI chess engine written in C++20. It combines a neural network trained entirely on self-generated games with a deeply optimized search, featuring PVS with iterative deepening, Lazy SMP multi-threaded search, and a wide range of pruning, reduction, and extension techniques. The network is embedded directly into the binary, updated incrementally during search, and accelerated with SIMD instructions for fast inference.

# How to use

Download the latest release from [the releases page](https://github.com/AnanyTanwar/Catalyst/releases). Catalyst implements the UCI protocol and works with any UCI-compatible GUI such as [CuteChess](https://cutechess.com/), [En Croissant](https://encroissant.org/), or [Banksia](https://banksiagui.com/).

Choose the binary that matches your CPU:

| Binary | Requirements |
|:-------|:-------------|
| `avx512vnni` | AVX-512 + VNNI (Cascade Lake, Zen 4+) |
| `avx512` | AVX-512 + BMI2 (Ice Lake, Rocket Lake+) |
| `bmi2` | AVX2 + BMI2 (Haswell+, Zen 3+) |
| `avx2` | AVX2 (Broadwell+, Excavator+) |
| `sse41` | SSE4.1 (Core 2 Penryn+, Phenom II+) |
| `x86-64` | x86-64 + POPCNT |

> **AMD Zen 1 / Zen 2 users:** use `avx2` even if your CPU supports BMI2 — `pext`/`pdep` are microcoded and very slow on these chips.

# Building from source

Requires GCC ≥ 13 or Clang ≥ 16, `objcopy`, and CMake ≥ 3.16 (for CMake builds). The NNUE weights are downloaded and embedded automatically at build time.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnanyTanwar/Catalyst
cd Catalyst
```

## Make

```bash
make -j native              # recommended — optimised for your CPU

# specific Linux architectures
make -j linux-avx512vnni
make -j linux-avx512
make -j linux-bmi2
make -j linux-avx2
make -j linux-sse41
make -j linux-x86-64

# Windows (requires MinGW cross-compiler)
make -j win-avx512vnni
make -j win-avx512
make -j win-bmi2
make -j win-avx2
make -j win-sse41
make -j win-x86-64

# release bundles
make -j release-linux       # all Linux binaries
make -j release-win         # all Windows binaries
make -j release             # both

# PGO (profile-guided optimisation)
make pgo                    # native CPU
make pgo ARCH=avx2          # specific arch

# misc
make debug                  # O0 + debug symbols
make sanitize               # ASan + UBSan
make install                # installs to /usr/local/bin
make install PREFIX=/usr
make clean
make distclean              # also removes the NNUE file
```

## CMake

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
cmake --install build
```

To build specific architectures, pass the relevant flags:

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_NATIVE=OFF -DBUILD_AVX2=ON -DBUILD_BMI2=ON
cmake --build build -j
```

For PGO, run two passes:

```bash
# pass 1 — instrument
cmake -B build-pgo-gen -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCATALYST_PGO_GEN=ON
cmake --build build-pgo-gen -j
./build-pgo-gen/catalyst-native bench

# pass 2 — optimise
cmake -B build-pgo -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCATALYST_PGO_USE=ON
cmake --build build-pgo -j
```
